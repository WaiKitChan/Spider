# Spider
My own version of spider patience (with inspiration drawn from Microsoft Solitaire).

Not much is different from the well known Microsoft version of spider, except that I
have added giant mode (4 decks), 3 suit mode and my own graphics. The famous victory
animation has also been recreated!

This project was originally developped by me using Dev-C++. If one wishes to build it
into an executable, he may have to add Spider.ico into spider.rc and modify line 230
of main.c.

Despite being called "Ultra Spider Patience HD" by me, it is in fact not HD.
Required screen resolution: 1080p.

The executable creates a hidden save file spider.sav locally (in the same directory as
the executable).
